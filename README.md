## Overview
This project is my engineering portfolio which showcases all of my works, skills, and contact information with an added bonus of 3D elements to wrap it all up. I used React + Vite, TailWindCSS, and watched [JavaScript Mastery](https://youtu.be/0fYi8SGA20k?si=-yczXu4qSn2Av2Sx&t=2811) to jumpstart the basic structure of my website with a beginner guide/tutorial into three.js and React Fiber.
